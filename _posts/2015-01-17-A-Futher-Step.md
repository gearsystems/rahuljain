As I expected, this was just the beginning of the take off.

After successfully making the Contributor Graph, the job was to make the __pie charts__ for the number of commits, additions and deletions made by all the contributors. 

__API__ stands for _Application Programming Interface_. It is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types. An API defines functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising each other. There are also so called plug-in API available for facilitating integration of new features into existing applications.

__Pie Chart__ is very common and easy to understand. It is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into sectors to illustrate numerical proportion. The arc length of each sector is proportional to the quantity it represents. The purpose of displaying the pie charts is to show the number of commits, additions and deletions in an effective manner. By seeing the area of the angular arc, every contributor will get the information of the remaining contributors, their commits etc. Thus they will get more excited and try to emphasize on it.

__Documentation__ is a set of documents written/provided online(in this case). For online _Documentation_, we chose to write our blogs in the _markdown_ format. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub. So for the practice, there is a webpage called [dillinger.io] from which one can easily get used to it. It was very easy and I gained something more.

I'm still not very familiar with _GitHub_, but it's good to see that my current streak is now 3 days(not too much at all I know). But as I said earlier, it's just the starting.
