title: Improving Productivity of GEAR Systems

As a part of the task to improve the prodoctivity of the ever increasing modules of GEAR systems, I had to learn a lot of new things to work them out. As a part of this, I learnt to work with JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax which were completely alien langauages to me. I really enjoyed the learning curve, though initially it felt really hard, I had the continuous encouragement of my team members who forced me to live up to deadlines while at the same time helping me with the resources and the content I needed to pull off this application's module.

My teamleader has supported me throughout the project and my work so far, by continuously reviewing my code patches and helping me out in person whenever I was stuck. He also gave me the opportunity to lead a small team of two other open source contributors and in helping them finish the patch that they wanted to contribute to.

I am glad and learnt a lot about building standalone modules which worked for all testcases planned, This has helped me make better and more constructive decisions when building software solutions. I enjoyed my work and love to continue with the same vigour to make this application a success.
