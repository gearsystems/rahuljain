title: My First Contribution
---

Although writing a blog is new to me and I'm not used to it at all, I somehow managed to it as all my teammates cheered me up.

__Data Visualization__ is a visual representation of data, meaning _"information that has been abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or variables for the units of information_". The primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users via the information graphics selected, such as tables and charts. Thus effective visualization helps the users in analyzing and reasoning about data. It makes complex data more accessible, easier and understandable.

__Contributor Graph__ is a graph specifically built for the contributors to contribute towards a project. It involves the _Data Visualization_ aspect which simplifies the information and contributions made so far of the existing contributors. For the new contributors out wanting to do the contribution, it is also reliable in adding them too. The purpose of the EPICS GEAR Systems to include this Contributor Graph is allowing the contributors to contribute and making a cause of creating a good social society.

There always comes the point of getting something in someone's mind like what he/she learnt from the work etc. I learnt the d3.js in order to make the required graph. D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It stands for _Data Driven Documents_. This visualization framework allows us to visualize the data that is being generated, after all ... a graph is better than an excel sheet.

So, it was whole a lot of new experience to me and I'm really excited to take this project as far as possible we can.
